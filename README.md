#Getting started


In order to use this seed you'll need to install **node** with **npm** and **bower**.

 - [How to install node and npm?](http://www.joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm)
 - [How to install bower?](http://bower.io/) (install npm first)

Once done clone this repository and go into the folder. Should be fast, the seed is pretty light

    git clone git@github.com:roine/angularJS-boosted.git brume && cd $_
    
Now you're going to need to download all the packages. This is pretty straightforward, just run the two following commands in your shell, and you're done!
    
    $ npm install
    $ bower install
